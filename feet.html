	<p>When we think of wearable technology, we don’t see ballet shoes as a wearable device. But in fact, E-Traces pointe shoes designed by Lesia Trubat, may be the world’s first wearable ballet shoes. The shoes capture the movement and pressure of the dancer’s feet using Lilypad Arduino technology and transmits this information to a smartphone via Bluetooth.</p>
	<h2>A magnetic Bluetooth smart electronic anklet that snaps onto each smart sock collects data and transmits it wirelessly to Sensoria’s mobile app.</h2>
